# HAPAC marketing website

This is a website I created to promote my high school science club HAPAC (HSGS Applied Physics & Astronomy Club).
I created this while I was learning HTML/CSS and a little bit of Javascript and I did not use bootstrap for template, so it does not have a responsive and therefore not compatible with any other devices beside PCs/laptops.
